# frezz
Frezz is an artificial intelligence project for detecting the freshness of certain fruits, such as apples, oranges, and bananas, using deep learning techniques. This project was created as a group project for the Artificial Intelligence course.
<br>This repository contains the source code and final presentation in PDF format.

**Solution** <br>
Frezz uses deep learning techniques to analyze the images of the fruits and determine their freshness level. The project includes a dataset of images of fresh and non-fresh fruits, which was used to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. The trained model is then used to predict the freshness of fruits from input images.

**Dataset** <br>
The dataset used to train the CNN model in Frezz was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sriramr/fruits-fresh-and-rotten-for-classification). The dataset includes images of fresh and non-fresh fruits, specifically apples, oranges, and bananas.
